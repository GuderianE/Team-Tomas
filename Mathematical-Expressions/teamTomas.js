// + Addition 
// The addition operator works the same way as we know it from math it joins together two variables or more and returns the sum or concats variable strings.
let x = 4;
let y = 6;

let sum = x + y;
console.log(sum);// 10

// - Substraction
// The substraction operator works the same way as we know it from math it subtracts one variable from another and returns the difference
let x1 = 4;
let y1 = 6;

let sum1 = x - y;
console.log(sum1);// -2

// * Multiplication
// The multiplication operator works the same way as we know it from math it multiplies two variables or more returning the sum
let x2 = 4;
let y2 = 6;

let sum2 = x * y;
console.log(sum2);// 24

// / Devision
// The division operator works the same way as we know it from math it divides variables and produces the quotient
let x3 = 4;
let y3 = 6;

let sum3 = x / y;
console.log(sum3);// 0.6666666666666666

// % Remainder
//The remainder operator returns the remainder of two given variables
let x4 = 4;
let y4 = 6;

let sum4 = x % y;
console.log(sum4);// 4
